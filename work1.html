<h2>I. Social Issues</h2>	<br>

Current social problems are the lack of integral and true freedom, which permits that each individual seeks itself and forms of expression and way of living that s/he deems the most appropriate for him/her. 
 
We see that we follow blindly manipulated by taboos, and that the system of society with its workers, rich, and governors, also manipulates us to fix life as a finite and fixed game, with its rigid rules, and lack of spontaneous fun.

The social aspect is very important to us. So we started to investigate how society , from the house to the national palace, has put restrictions us. What are the forms of personal and social control that exist today?

To clarify, the most pervasive manipulation is the one closest.  Every day we all make movements, actions, that can be neutral, or trying to influence another person.

     <h2>II. Rejection of the above</h2> <br>

We reject the past, which is something dead. We do not say that what happened before does not help us to look for landmarks, to live with a full sense of being. However we use our vision of the future as the preferred psychologic reference. At the same time, the past traps us by its flaws and emotional weight that which manipulates the present, making the future. So the saying goes "The past is the future." But we Freists say "The future the past becomes." If we go back in time, taking advantage of the nature of the moment, we can connect with a cure that destroys mental terror of what comes and what happened. We use the power of the moment to make us new benchmarks.

The enemy of Freeism is in and out of each person. The enemy is slave-think, non free actions, and being unaware that we do not act through choices and roles. The weight of the past and unplanned future blind us. It attracts fear that keeps us from relying on the moment.

We can learn to be aware that we are actors, and then to change our ways of expressing ourselves, to exchange the roles and scripts that have given us the cultural and state system, etc. to roles and thoughts and actions that would be free of the  programming of others. 
Let die any individual or social control that denies us the right to seek real freedom.
The past is control filled with traditions, taboos, and deaths that are allowed to direct our lives.

	
<h2>III New Road</h2>	


The new road starts with self-awareness and a reimagined freedom . The game concept and its execution is vital to the Freist. Play is essential to learn new ways of being, to escape the inner death, the social scum, to shape the new vision

The concept according to Freeism is no more than ritualization (generation of  forms) of fun, self-expression. Up to this point, we will do free actions that focus on the quality of the game of life, instead of monotone and robotic quality - the hateful rationalism which is all the rage in our time. In the end, the movement is for the individual and not culture or society. We are anti-other, and anti-control. In other words, we believe in the sanctity of the individual over the group. It is not that we are against the group, but we believe that every person should be free in their actions. If we look upon our lives, we will see that we were born into several groups that have tried to control us since the beginning. Through the game and other creativeness and curative actions one could make her/his way gradually out of this inherited manipulation.

We are not against the social, but the giant insidious tool of society is on that promotes group-think, actions of desperation and a constant state of unfreedom, when we are not free to act for the pressure of being both the oppressors and the oppressed. 

We propose to think for yourself, do little things in your daily life, seek a constant state of freedom to be, and to question the stories that you have internalised.  

You have the key to your innate freedom. No text or event can help you be free, only by way of actions and acceptance of modern situation can be free.

Although Freeism is the destruction of post-modernism, it does not propose this.

Therefore, it does not say anything, on that to feel and act freely is a possibility for us humans.
