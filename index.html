        O.R.  71/020/17  B A E S  Vak Ctl Unit</pre> <br>
        
        What a life. We barely made the line, though we did it efficiently in 5343 sillaseks which is a Vak record.  “Annihilate the entire
        ent Aev” was the clear directive. Bombard the hordes, that’s what CAx always says. He says, “B A E S, I guess we’re going to bombard the hordes today.”  And he usually grins, and then I ask “Again?” And we both have a good smile, yes, a fairly decent smile. What a life!  
        <br><br>
        There have been micro - disasters before, thanks to new members to the Vak, who are just getting their hands firm in Ctl, the actual method and execution. The grand purpose.  The great work.  
        <br><br>
        What’s to be done?  Nothing. Ctl dok camp is the same as it always has been, accordingly. Recruits complete it, or die. Then they’re with the Vak, or one of the other alleged and unknown and numerous undisclosed bodies. With the Vak, they either learn to redact, vaporize, and MOVE; or they die.  “Die” is an old word, and not permitted any longer in any conversation. As of now, it is still allowed in written form. Thankfully, though unfortunately. Some of us don’t take to repatterning, though we are kept on, us Salients.
        <br><br>
        Why? Well we are quick to act, and maintain the line. The overheads
        are quite keen of the proficiency of every unit and I agree. It keeps me a life, and not canceled.
        <br><br>
        
        Today, we lost another one.  But, the Aev are no problem. The sector is clear, and we will be about more situations after re-activisions.

        This is an entry from a cyborg, reintegrated under the name of B A E S.  It believes itself to be  native organic, with ident intact. The damaged cerebrum was replaced with a piv1 cortex reactor a.p.r,
        and from what can be gleaned from this ‘report’ it is functioning and has subsumed into the host matter.

        P.D 324 WC 232X – HM vs Triod</pre> <br>
        
We sold the big rock to some strange burglars. In a dark alley shop. Constantine
had the decency to negotiate so we earned 20k of slirps more. With that amount of money,
I could pursue my trip a little further. Maybe even I would be able to slip into the P.D 56. I
heard their women were of the rarest beauty. I always thought I was meant to find a lady
from another dimension, to see her light gait as she flies in my head, to smell her lila
perfume, to listen to her screaming at me in some weird language, to gaze her silence. I
always could picture her without knowing. Maybe she would be a mermaid from Heliseo, a
nymph from Repag, or a white witch from Blair or she wouldn’t even exist. At least I knew
her in my dreams and the crystal could break, the lit could drown in a vivid transparency, at
least I knew her. Yes, I always wished to live in the dome of an alter reality sharing with
another understanding soul. Nothing concrete, just some altered reality. Far from the
normal perspective. In some deep real world. The two of us. As a simple viewer. Admirer.
Nothing concrete. Simple as observation and accomplice contestation. Nothing is more
real that sharing our point of view, your decisions and your decoy. It is great to feel that at
least you own that. Something without meaning. You don’t have to respect, to expect
anything. And you bring the shared faith to the game playing by your own rules. Fuck it.
Just be smart. <br><br>
Constantine and Plex were dreaming on worldly situations. They rather pay for
some illusions of love than feel. I couldn’t blame them. I used to think I was one of the last
Romantix.
